This program was started in 1995, and grew and evolved with the game engine.
It started as a DOS/4G program which read 3DSR4 project files, in 1997 it was 
port to 3DSStudio Max as a plugin, then in late 1999 it was ported back
to a command line program (win32 this time) that reads .lev files (iff format)
exported from Max. This was done to separate the level conversion code from the
level editing package in preperation for porting to linux and some other
3d program.
Needless to say, the code base is a mess. A lot of cruft has accumulated, and
it really needs a re-write. However, the game engine is a bit persnickity
about its level format, so this is not a small task, and therefore this tool
remains.
