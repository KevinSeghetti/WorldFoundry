Subject: I. General questions about this FAQ 

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Maintainer's Comments

The GFF FAQ is now included in the Sandy Bay Software PC Webopaedia
at: 
  http://www.sandybay.com/pc-web/graphics_file_format.htm

In case nobody noticed, there were no October or November releases
of the GFF FAQ. Too busy with other projects and not much new or
revised info to include. Starting next month the GFF FAQ will be 
posted to Usenet every 60 days. I will continue to revise the GFF FAQ
on its Web site every month at:

  http://www.ora.com/centers/gff/gff-faq/

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What's new in this latest FAQ release?
  
  o Revised a few product entries in part 2
  o Revised a few file formats in part 3

------------------------------

Subject: 2. Why does a graphics formats FAQ exist?

The purpose of this FAQ is to answer many of the frequently asked questions
about graphics file formats posted on Usenet. You will find definitions of
terms, references to format information, very general descriptions of many
formats, information on programs which read, write, convert, and display
graphics files, and some handy programming tips for writing your own code. 
This FAQ is not a substitute for actual file format specifications, nor can
it possibly go into a great amount of specific detail on graphics file
formats.

Subject: 5. I have a question, correction, or some information for this FAQ.

All questions, comments, additions, and corrections should be sent to the
author of this FAQ at jdm@ora.com.

I don't always read the newsgroups this FAQ is posted to, so please contact
me directly via email rather than attempting to reach me by posting to a
newsgroup. All suggestions and contributions within the scope of this FAQ
are welcome and contributors receive full credit in the Acknowledgments
section of this FAQ.

------------------------------

Subject: 6. This FAQ doesn't contain enough detail!

This FAQ only attempts to answer Frequently Asked Questions. It is not a
book on graphics file formats. It is instead a thick source of information
that will help you obtain more information that you need. Or perhaps even
clear up a few of your misconceptions and thereby saving you from wasting
some time.

------------------------------

Subject: 7. Why isn't the XXX file format covered?

If you have read and/or grepped this FAQ and not found information on the
format you need the reason might be that:

  * You are looking for the format under the wrong name.

  * This FAQ is new and the information you need hasn't been included yet.

  * I don't know about the format and I need you to email me information
    on it (See Subject: 5).

  * The format is proprietary and its caretakers do not wish information
    on the format distributed in this FAQ.

And let me make one thing perfectly clear: I have have not proposley
omitted the reference to any file formats, books, or software applications
that I see as within the scope of this FAQ. If you don't see information
here that you consider relavent and necessary, then *tell me* and I will
include it.

------------------------------

Subject: 8. Why aren't audio file formats covered?

Information on file formats used specifically for storing audio data
are already covered quite nicely by the Audio File Formats FAQ
maintained by Guido van Rossum 
<guido@cnri.reston.va.us>
or <guido@python.org>.

You may obtain this FAQ from the Usenet newsgroups comp.dsp, comp.answers, and news.answers, from the FTP archive sites:

  ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/audio/
  ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/comp.dsp/

or via the Web page:

  http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/audio/AudioFormats.part1/
  http://www.cwi.nl/ftp/audio/AudioFormats.part2/

The FAQ for comp.speech may of also be of interest to audio people. It is
available at:

  ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/comp-speech-faq/
  ftp://svr-ftp.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/comp.speech/FAQ-complete

------------------------------

Subject: 9. Why aren't word processing formats covered?

It is true that there are many types of file formats that cannot store
graphics data (older word processor and spreadsheet formats, and so forth).
These formats are not within the scope of this FAQ and are therefore not
covered. Perhaps someone who works in the biz of writing file translators
for these formats will put together such a FAQ one day.

------------------------------

Subject: 10. What about multimedia file formats?

Multimedia file formats store more than just graphics data. They may also
contain audio, video, animation, and textual data in addition to bitmapped
and vectored graphics. Such formats, although a superset of graphics
formats, are considered to be within the scope of this FAQ and are
therefore covered.  Also check the comp.multimedia FAQ for additional
information you may require.

------------------------------

Subject: 11. What is an "Internet File Format?"

If you have searched the Web lately using the key phrases "file format", 
"data format", or "graphics format", you have most likely run across many
Web pages claiming to have all the information you need on "Internet File
Formats." In fact, there is no such thing.

The Internet is a global communications network used for one thing--to
move data from one location to another. The data does not need to be in
the format of a "file" to be moved, nor are file and data formats created
originally for use on the Internet (e.g. MIME, X.400, uucode, and so
forth) only found on the Internet.

There are many file formats you will constantly encounter while using the
Internet. GIF and JPEG for still-images, MPEG, MOV, and AVI for video, WAV
and AU for audio, Z and gz for compressed files, and ZIP, tar, and ARJ for
file archives. And while these formats are found in great profusion on the
Internet, they were by no means created to be specifically used on or by
the Internet and its community. Therefore, the term "Internet File Format"
is inaccurate and misleading.

------------------------------

Subject: 12. Which file formats should I and should I not use?

  [ Still working on this ]


------------------------------

Subject: 13. What is ray tracing?

The following FTP sites and Web pages contain ray tracing information:

    The Ray Tracing Home Page

  http://www.povray.org/rtn/
    Ray Tracing News Guide

------------------------------

Subject: II. General Graphics File Questions 

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Who cares about graphics file formats?

Well, programmers do mostly. But end-users (that is, non-programmers) do as
well.

The typical end-user only cares about storing their graphics information
using a format that most graphics programs and filters can read. End-users
are typically not concerned with the internal arrangement of the data
within the graphics file itself. They only want the format to do its job
by representing their data correctly in a permanent form.

Programmers, on the other hand, are that rare breed of human that just
can't leave information well enough alone. They need to know how every
byte is arranged to see if someone knows something that they don't (and
often snicker contentedly to themselves when they find that it is really
they that know more). Programmers will then use this information to write
code that may never see the light of distribution, but nevertheless, they
will have had fun and gained enlightenment from writing it.

It doesn't matter which of these two types of people you are. If you have
even the slightest interest in graphics file formats then you may be
counted as one who cares.

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What is raster, vector, metafile, PDL, VRML, and so forth?

These terms are used to classify the type of data a graphics file contains.
Raster files (also called bitmapped files) contain graphics information
described as pixels, such as photographic images. Vector files contain
data described as mathematical equations and are typically used to store
line art and CAD information. Metafiles are formats that may contain
either raster or vector graphics data. Page Description Languages (PDL)
are used to describe the layout of a printed page of graphics and text.
Animation formats are usually collections of raster data that is displayed
in a sequence. Multi-dimensional object formats store graphics data as a
collection of objects (data and the code that manipulates it) that may be
rendered (displayed) in a variety of perspectives. Virtual Reality
Modeling Language (VRML) is a 3D, object-oriented language used for
describing "virtual worlds"  networked via the Internet and hyperlinked
within the World Wide Web. Multimedia file formats are capable of storing
any of the previously mentioned types of data, including sound and video
information. 

------------------------------

Subject: 2. Why should I care about previous versions of a file format?

When version 2.0 of the XXX format is released all of the thousands of
files created using version 1.0 of the XXX format don't magically
disappear or transform to version 2.0 overnight. Although version 2.0
might claim to be fully backwards compatible, the new specification may
obfuscate or even omit details of the previous version of the format. In
short, never throw away older information just because you have something
newer. At one point in time that "out dated" format spec was
state-of-the-art, and it may still contain a singular precious tid-bit of
information that the caretakers of the format didn't carry over to the new
spec (but Murphy will make sure you desperately need to know).

------------------------------

Subject: 3. Can graphics files be infected with a virus?

For most types of graphics file formats currently available the answer is
"no". A virus (or worm, Trojan horse, and so forth) is fundamentally a
collection of code (that is, a program) that contains instructions which
are executed by a CPU. Most graphics files, however, contain only static
data and no executable code. The code that reads, writes, and displays
graphics data is found in translation and display programs and not in the
graphics files themselves. If reading or writing a graphics file caused a
system malfunction is it most likely the fault of the program reading the
file and not of the graphics file data itself.

With the introduction of multimedia we have seen new formats appear, and
modifications to older formats made, that allow executable instructions to
be stored within a file format. These instructions are used to direct
multimedia applications to play sounds or music, prompt the user for
information, or display other graphics and video information. And such
multimedia display programs may perform these functions by interfacing
with their environment via an API, or by direct interaction with the
operating system. One might also imagine a truly object-oriented graphics
file as containing the code required to read, write, and display itself.

Once again, any catastrophes that result from using these multimedia
application is most like the result of unfound bugs in the software and
not some sinister instructions in the graphics file data. Such "logic
bombs" are typically exorcised through the use of testing using a wide
variety of different image files for test cases.

If you have a virus scanning program that indicates a specific graphics
file is infected by virus, then it is very possible that the file
coincidentally contains a byte pattern that the scanning programming
recognizes as a key byte signature identifying a virus. Contact the author
(or even read the documentation!) of the virus scanning program to discuss
the probability of the mis-identification of a clean file as being
infected by a virus. Save the graphics file, as the author will most
likely wish to examine it as well.

If you suspect a graphics file to be at the heart of a virus problem you
are experiencing, then also consider the possibility that the graphics
file's transport mechanism (floppy disk, tape or shell archive file,
compressed archive file, and so forth) might be the original source of the
virus and not the graphics file itself.

------------------------------

Subject: 4. Can graphics files be encrypted?

Of course you can encrypt a graphics file. After all, most encryption
algorithms don't care about the intellectual content of a file. All they
chew on is a series of byte values. Therefore, most any encryption program
that works on ordinary text files will work on graphics files as well.

Why would you want to encrypt a graphics file? Mostly to control who can
view its contents. You can invent a proprietary file format and that might
slow a file format hack down for, say, five or ten minutes. You could add
a proprietary data compression scheme, possibly a twisted variation of an
already public algorithm. But there are so many people out there with
nothing better to do than hack at unknown data formats that your data
would probably be exposed in little time. But suppose we top off all this
effort by encrypting the graphics file itself as we would an ordinary text
file. Would your data then be safe?

Realize that an encrypted graphics file still might not be very secure.
For every data encryption algorithm there exists at least one method of
getting around it, although it may take hundreds of computers and many
years to fully employ and execute that method!

For example, one of the more popular methods used to encrypt data is the
Vernam or XOR cipher. This cipher Exclusive ORs the plain-text data with a
single, random, fixed-length key. The longer the key the harder it is to
break the cipher. A totally random key the length of your data is
impossible to break. Shorter and less-random keys are easier to break.

XOR is very simple and fast, which is a must for a graphics file
translators/viewers that must decrypt a file on the fly. A problem,
however, is that most graphics files contain fixed size headers which vary
only slightly in content from file to file. If you knew the approximate
contents of the header of an encrypted file you could XOR a "decrypted"
header with the encrypted file and possibly produce the key used to
encrypt the file. A short key might be very easily discovered in this way.

If you wish to use a public key/private key encryption method, then
storing the public key in the file format header (usually as a 4-byte
field) and only encrypting the image data would be the way to go. The
SMPTE DPX file format supports such an encryption feature.

If you really need to make the contents of a graphics file secure, then
I'd suggest not only using some form of data encryption, but also create
an unconventional and proprietary file format and do not publish its
format specification.

    and Source Code in C", John Wiley & Sons, 1994.

------------------------------

Subject: 5. How can I convert the XXX format to the YYY format?

With a file conversion program, of course! Without a doubt one of the
most frequently asked categories of questions on comp.graphics.misc
is how to convert one format to another. In every case the answer is
some type of conversion program or filter, but which one?

Section IV of the FAQ is an attempt to list every known graphics file
display and conversion program and application. Although far from
complete, this list may contain the program you need. Go to the
subsection of the particular operating system you are using and scan
through Imports: and Exports: formats listed and see if the formats
you needs to use are there.

In some cases the information in a listing may make the conversion
capabilities of a program a bit misleading. For example, a program
that can import a vector .DWG file and export a raster .BMP file may
not necessarily be able to perform a .DWG->.BMP (vector->raster)
conversion (AutoCAD R12 can, BTW). And just because a program can
both import and export TIFF files doesn't mean it's capable of a
TIFF(CMYK)->TIFF(RGB) conversion (as Adobe Photoshop can do). As
always, read the documentation, contact and ask the author of the
program, or find a user of the program and ask them.

------------------------------

Subject: 6. Do I really need the specification of the format I'm using?

It depends upon the results you are trying to obtain. If you have code
that supports the XXX format and you find it easy (and legal) to integrate
that code into your program, then you may be tempted to do so. But realize
that your program will support the XXX format in just the same way as the
previous program did. In other words, your program will now work the same,
but it will really be no better.

By obtaining the format specification you can make an attempt to fully
support all of the features and capabilities a graphics or multimedia file
format has to offer. If you use pre-written code that only supports a
small subset of the format's features then you are not doing justice to
the format and cheating your users out of functionality they might need.

Always strive to create the best programs possible within reason of time
and money. Obtain the specs, look at code, and talk to programmers who
have worked with the format before. You might gain some insight and save
yourself some hair-pulling by supporting a feature that someone didn't
think to include in the original requirements for your program.

------------------------------

Subject: 7. How can I tell if a graphics file is corrupt?

The easiest way is to display the file and decide if what you see on the
screen or the printer is correct. This method is not fool-proof, however,
because not all information stored in a graphics file is used for
displaying the data it contains. Textual comments, alternate color maps,
and unused fields in the header might be munged and go undetected.

A frequent source of corruption occurs when 8-bit graphics data is
transported via a 7-bit communications channel. The 8th bit of each byte
is cleared (set to zero) and you are left with garbage. ASCII-mode file
transfers may also translate carriage returns (0Dh) to line feeds (0Ah),
or to CR/LF pairs depending upon if the file is being transferred to a
Unix (LF-only), Macintosh (CR-only), or MS-DOS (CR/LF) system.

The PNG file format supports an elegant solution to the quick detection of
this type of corruption. The first character of every PNG file is the
8-bit value 89h. If this value is read as 09h, the 8th bit has been zeroed
and you know the file is corrupt.

Most graphics files do not contain any real, built-in error detection
features. The standard way to check for corruption of any type of data
file is to perform some sort of error-detection scheme on the file. Such
schemes commonly used are Checksum calculations and the Cyclic Redundancy
Check (CRC).  These algorithms are commonly used in the world of
synchronous serial communications for detecting errors in data streams.

If you only wanted to provide error detection for the graphical data
contained in a file, but not the header, then a 2- or 4-byte field in the
header could be used to store the CRC-16 or CRC-32 value of the data. But
what good is pure data if the header is possibly corrupt? 

If we calculate the CRC value of the entire file and then store that
calculated value in the header we will have just "corrupted" the file! You
could initialize the CRC field with zeros, calculate the value, store the
value, and specify that the entire file need be read into memory and the
CRC value field set to all zeros before the CRC calculation is made. 

File formats that segment their data into blocks or chunks would be able
to perform a CRC on each section individually (another feature found in
the PNG file format). Each section would store the CRC value as the last 2
or 4 bytes of the block and the CRC value field would never be read for
the purpose of the CRC calculation. This method makes it easier to find
the location of the error(s) in a file. If the CRC error occured in an
unnecessary block of data, the file might still be useful anyway. This
block-style CRC checking also saves the reader from performing a
time-consuming CRC calculation an entire, possibly very large, graphics
file.

But all this can be quite a pain. Can't we avoid modifying a file and just
store the CRC value externally to the file? Maybe using some sort of
encapsulating "wrapper"?

If you want to make sure a graphics file (or any file for that matter) has
been transported through a communications channel without sustaining any
corruption, first store it using a file archiving program that supports
error checking of the files contained in the archive. (Several good
error-checking file archiving programs include PKZIP, gzip, and zoo. The
ar and tar Unix archiving programs do not support error checking). When
the graphics file is stored, the archival program calculates the CRC value
of the file. If the CRC value does not match the file's calculated CRC
after it is unarchived after transport, you know that the file has been
corrupted.

Note: make sure you turn compression OFF when archiving many types of
graphics files. File archival programs use compression by default and will
attempt to make your compressed data even smaller (which usually results
in larger data, unless the archiver is smart enough to detect the negative
compression and not attempt to compress the file). ASCII-based files (such
as PostScript and DXF) and some RLE-encoded files (such as PCX) will be
compressed, while other formats supporting more advanced data compression
methods (such as JPEG and LZW) will surely grow in size.

------------------------------

Subject: 8. What do I put in my own graphics file format specification?

For people that are faced with the task of writing up a specification for
their own format (or perhaps to better document someone else's), a few
suggestions are hereby offered.

  A large spec needs a table of contents, bibliography, and an index.
  Most specs do not fall into this category though.

  On the cover sheet give the full information of your company, products
  associated with the format, the format version, date of release, 
  where the latest copy of the spec may be obtained, and how developers
  may get in contact with you to ask questions.

  Detail the full history of the spec (including the difference between the
  current version and all previous versions) and not just the dates of its
  revision. Tell why the format was created. Detail some insights of
  how it was designed. Speculate on what features future version might
  contain. And give the names of your developers and other people
  involved. Show the human thought that exists behind the cold chunk of
  data that is your format.

  List the features of your format and explain how you intend that it
  should be used and not used (tell what your format is and is not).
  Give the developer your reasons that they should use your format (and
  why they should not bother with others).
  
  Include both block diagrams and ANSI C code examples of the format's
  internal data structures. Illustrate actual examples of ASCII file
  format data and hexadecimal dumps of binary format data (very useful
  to programmers, I might say).

  If your format includes one or more forms of data compression, error
  checking, encryption, etc., place this information in a separate
  section and give plenty of examples (both written and code) of how
  these algorithms work. Include mathematical formulas if you believe it
  makes your concepts clearer.

  Make the specification available both in hardcopy and electronic
  form. The hardcopy version should be formatted as a technical
  document and using a font that won't degrade badly when the spec is
  photocopied or faxed. Use a standard sized page layout so the spec
  isn't a hassle to fit in an envelope when mailed. The electronic
  version should be available as both ASCII text and PostScript files.
  Making the spec available in a word processing format (such as
  Microsoft Word or Framemaker) is nice, but not absolutely necessary.

  Consider making a developer's toolkit for your format. A collection
  of benchmark graphics files (one of each flavor of your format), and
  a parser written in ANSI C that reads and writes your format, is of
  tremendous help to programmers. Such a kit will allow developers to
  implement your format quickly in their products and helps minimize
  the chances of numerous software packages appearing which create
  graphics files that don't meet your spec. Examples of formats with
  toolkits include TIFF, TGA (Truevision), WordPerfect Graphics (WPG),
  and PNG.

  Submit your specification to every FTP/Gopher/WWW site and BBS that
  archives file format specs. Notify the maintainers of related FAQs
  (graphics, animation, multimedia, audio, medical, etc.) that your
  format exists and ask for a mention. Send your literature to graphics
  and imaging software companies to sell support of your format and/or
  software products.

And a few guidelines on good technical writing in general:

  Write in a tutorial style with explanations and examples of your
  topics. Don't just give a terse, dictionary description of a topic
  which often leaves the readers confused and needing more.

  Write in simple terms. Don't assume your readers enjoy 70-word
  sentences, or have advanced degrees in mathematics or computer
  graphics. 

  Have other people read and attempt to understand your spec. Don't
  assume that just because you understand what you've written that
  every reader will too. You, as the file format specification's
  author, understand the format inside and out. Your readers, however,
  do not. An explanation that may seem clear to you may be just
  another confusing paragraph to your readers.

  Write for a world-wide audience of programmers. Omit slang or regional
  expressions that a developer living on the other side of the planet
  might not understand.

  Programs that check spelling and grammar are our friends. Use them.

Examples of some well-written format specs include: TGA, TIFF, PNG, EPSF,
and PostScript. Some specs are written well, but contain so much
extraneous information that they are quite complex and very tedious to
read. Most government and military formats are in this group (for example,
CALS, NITF, NAPLPS, IGES, GKS, and CGM). Format specs such as PCX, GIF,
JFIF, and Sun Raster definitely fall into the "don't let this happen to
you" catagory.

Subject: III. Working with Graphics Files on Usenet and the Internet 

------------------------------

Subject: 0. How can I email a graphics file?

Normally you would move a file around the Internet using a data transport
program that handles binary data, such as UUCP and FTP. If you only have
an ASCII-only data transport mechanism available to you, such as
electronic mail, you will need to convert your binary graphics files to an
ASCII format before sending them. This process is only necessary for
binary files.  ASCII-based file formats, such as DXF and PostScript, do
not require uuencoding before emailing.

On the Unix operating system you will use a program called uuencode to
convert the 8-bit data of a graphics file to a 7-bit ASCII data file. The
data file is then emailed and uudecoded on the receiving end.

To uuencode and email a file:

  % uuencode picture.img picture.img | Mail user@host.site

This command will pipe the output of the uuencode command to the input of
an email program. Realize that if your email program is set up to keep a
copy of all of the email you send, and you email a lot of uuencoded
graphics files, your outgoing email folder will grow quite large. You can
modify your .mailrc (or equivalent) file to route the copy of the outgoing
graphics file to /dev/null, or you can write-protect your outgoing mail
folder so the data can't be written:

  % chmod -w ~/Mail/mbox.out
  % uuencode picture.img picture.img | Mail user@host.site
  /home/Mail/mbox.out: Permission denied
  % chmod +w ~/Mail/mbox.out

Once the emailed data is received, you will need to strip off the mailing
header before you can uudecode it. The uuencoded data starts with the word
"begin" and is followed by the file mode, file name, and a series of
61-character lines. The file is ASCII, so you can use an editor such as vi
to do the stripping. Assuming the received data is saved to a file named
"file", the uudecoing process is thus:

  % uudecode file

The original graphics file is now in the current directory. You may delete
the uuencoded file if you wish to do so.

The uuencode and uudecode programs have been ported to other systems, such
as MS-DOS, MS Windows, OS/2, Amiga, and the Macintosh (the BinHex program
for the Mac does not produce the same ASCII data as uuencode), and may be
used in the same way.

For more information on accessing the Internet via email, please refer to
the FAQ "Accessing The Internet By E-Mail: Doctor Bob's Guide to Offline
Internet Access", found on the news.answers and alt.internet.services Usenet
newsgroups and your favorite FAQ archives.

------------------------------

Subject: 1. Where can I find graphics files on Usenet?

The vast majority of graphics files posted to Usenet will be found in the
alt.binaries.pictures.* newgroups. If you do not have access to Usenet,
then you will not be able to retrieve files posted to these groups.

For much more information on the alt.binaries.pictures.* newsgroups, please
consult the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ (pictures-faq/part[1-3]) posted to
news.answers and alt.binaries.pictures.d.

------------------------------

Subject: 2. How do I decode a graphics file posted to Usenet?

Graphics files are posted to Usenet as uuencoded binaries. Although you
may see files posted using BinHex or someother ASCII format, the uuencode
data format is the defacto standard of Usenet.

A graphics file may be contained in a single-part posting, which you will
save to a file, strip off the mailing header using a text editor, and use
the uudecode program to convert the data into the original graphics file.
Many online news readers will perform this operation for you.

Graphics files are usually quite large and uuencoding will increase the
file size by another 33%. For this reason, graphics files (and most binary
files) are split into 1000 line or 60KB chunks (multi-part postings) for
easier handling. If each chunk includes a shell wrapper (the string "[sh]"
usually appears in the Subject:  line of such postings), online news
readers, such as tin, can tag each part of the posting and decode it into
the original file for you. 

The most labor-intensive way to decode a multi-part uuencoded posting is to
save each part into a separate file, edit each file to remove the mailing
headers, concatenate them all into a single file, uudecode the file, and
delete the original parts:

  % vi picture.1 picture.2 picture.3
  % cat picture.1 picture.2 picture.3 | uudecode
  % rm picture.1 picture.2 picture.3

There are, of course, several utilities to decode single- and multi-part
binary posting for you without all this bother. Please refer to the
alt.binaries.pictures FAQ (pictures-faq/part[1-3]) posted to news.answers
and alt.binaries.pictures.d for more information on decoding graphics files
posted to Usenet.

------------------------------

Subject: 3. How can I post a graphics file to Usenet?

Posting a graphics file to a Usenet newsgroup is very similar to emailing
a graphics file, but there are some important extra steps you must take in
order to do so.

First, a graphics file must be uuencoded. That is, converted from 8-bit
binary data to 7-bit ASCII data. Second, the resulting uuencoded file must
be split into 60K chunks (1000 lines) for posting. And lastly, each chunk
posted must be given a description and a part number.

Under Unix we would use the uuencode, split, expr, and inews commands to
post a graphics (or any binary) file as such:

  % uuencode picture.img picture.img > picture.img.uue
  % split -1000 picture.img.uue picture.img.uue.
  % ls
  Total 535
  picture.img        picture.img.uue    picture.img.uue.1  
  picture.img.uue.2  picture.img.uue.3
  % sh
  $ i=1
  $ for j in picture.img.uue.*; do
  > (echo "Subject: picture.img [$i/3]"
  > echo "Newsgroups: news.test
  > echo
  > cat $j) | /usr/lib/news/inews
  > i=`expr "$i" + 1`
  > done
  $ rm picture.img.*
  $ exit
  %

In this example, we take a graphics file named picture.img, uuencode it,
and place the output in a file names picture.img.uue. This file is then
split into three chunks named picture.img.uue.1, picture.img.uue.2, and 
picture.img.uue.3.  We then loop through each file and create a Subject:
and Newsgroup: line for each of the file chunks and post them using inews.

There are, of course, programs which automate this process. One such
program is xmitBin, written by Jim Howard and availble via FTP from:

  ftp://ftp.cadence.com/utils
  http://mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu/~deej/index.html

Refer to the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ (pictures-faq/part[1-3]) posted to
news.answers and alt.binaries.pictures.d for more information on posting
graphics files to Usenet.

------------------------------

Subject: 4. How do I submit a file format specification to an archive?

There are several FTP and WWW sites which act as archives for graphics
file format specifications (see the section "Graphics and Image File FTP
Archives and WWW Pages"). If you have a file format specification that is
legal to share with the rest of the world-wide Internet community, then
you may wish to submit it to one or more of these archives.

There are generally two ways to submit a file format specification to an
FTP archive:

  1) Upload (or "put") the file in the /incoming or /pub/incoming directory.
  2) Email the file to the archive maintainer (the email address is usually
     in the README or similar file in the root FTP directory).

Realize that most FTP sites don't allow unsolicited uploads and instead
require you to contact the archive maintainer to make a submission. Many
sites are simply mirrors for other archives and don't accepts any kind of
submissions at all. 

In any case, it's usually good form to include a description file with
your submission to describe in a few words what you have uploaded and
where it originated. If your upload is named foo.doc then the description
file should be named foo.txt. If your upload is named foo.txt, improvise.

------------------------------

Subject: 5. How can I make transparent and interlaced GIFs for a Web page?

Transparent GIFs are used to eliminate the typical rectangular borders
associated with most bitmapped images that appear on a Web page. The
creator of a GIF image may set certain pixels within the bitmap to a color
desiganted within the image file as "transparent". When this GIF image is
displayed by a Web browser the transparent pixels take on the color of the
user's display.  This is identical to the blue screen effect found in
chromakeying.

GIF89a files are made transparent by the use of graphics file editing
software (GIF87a files do not support transparency and must first be
converted to the GIF89a format). Such software will set the transparency
color flag and the transparent color index value of a Graphics Control
Extension block within the GIF89a file. Any pixel set to the specified
transparent color index value will take on the background color of the
display device when displayed.

Interlaced GIFs are used to give the user a idea of that an image looks
like before all of the bitmapped data has been received. Non-interlaced
images paint in a linear fashion from the top to the bottom of the
display. Over a slow link it make take several minutes for an image to
paint. When 50% of the bitmapped data is received only the top half of the
image is displayed.  The contents bottom half is still a mystery to the
user.

Interlaced GIFs paint quickly over the entire display first as a very low
resolution image. Only about 12.5% of the bitmap is displayed in this
first pass. The GIF image is then repainted in three more passes, with
each pass supplying more resolution until all of the data is received
(12.5%, 25%, and 50% respectively). A user can usually get a good idea of
what the entire image is when only 30-50% of the bitmapped data has been
received. This is very useful for knowing when to abort an image being
viewd via a slow link.

Interlacing is supported by both the GIF87a and GIF89a formats. Graphics
file editing software that supports interlaced GIF should not only be able
to display such GIF files, but also convert non-interlaced GIFs to the
interlaced format (and back again as well). This involves reading in the
GIF bitmap and writing it back out using the GIF 4-pass interlace scheme.
In a non-interlaced GIF the pixel lines are displayed in consecutive
order. For example, the lines of a 16-line non-interlaced GIF file are
stored as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...15. The lines of the same 16-line bitmap in
an interlaced GIF would be stored as 0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 6, 10, 14, 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, 11, 13, 15.

Graphics file format software packages for Unix which handles both
trasparent and interlaced GIFs include NETPBM and giftool.  For the
Macintosh:  Transparency, Graphic Converter, Imagery, and clip2gif

The Visioneering image manipulation page will allow you to convert your
GIFs to transparent and interlaced without having special software on your
system. Your GIF files will be read, converted, and written using the Web.

Subject: IV. Copyrights, Patents, and other Legalities of Graphics File
Formats 

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Can a graphics file be copyrighted?

No. A graphics file cannot normally be copyrighted under United States
copyright laws (although the rulings of some judges may disagree on this).
The specification of a format and the contents of a graphics file,
however, are subject to copyright.

For anything to be copyrighted it must be:

  1) A work of authorship
  2) Fixed in a tangible medium of expression

The description of a graphics format does meet both of these criteria (it
is fixed in a medium and a work of authorship) and is therefore protected
under the copyright laws. A graphics file created using the format
description, however, meets the second criteria, but not the first (that
is, it is not considered to be a work of authorship). The format itself is
considered instead to be an idea or system, and is therefore not protected
by copyright.

So the description of a file format is copyrightable, but the format as it
exists in its medium is not. What about the graphics data that the file
contains?

If the graphical data written to a graphics file also meets the above two
criteria, then it is also protected by the copyright laws as intellectual
property. You will not wave your copyright protection by storing any
original information using a graphics file format.

For more information on copyright, please refer to the Copyright FAQ found
on the misc.legal, misc.legal.computing, misc.int-property, and
comp.patents newsgroups: 

  ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/law/Copyright-FAQ/

Subject: 1. Is it now illegal to use CompuServe's GIF format?

It is not illegal to own, transmit, or receive GIF files (provided that no
unlicensed compression and/or decompression of the files occurs). You must
realize, however, that GIF files are not the issue. The issue is, in fact,
the LZW data compression algorithm.

In 1984, while working for Sperry Corporation, Terry Welch modified the
Lempel-Ziv 78 (LZ78) compression algorithm for greater efficiency for
implementation in high-performance disk controllers. The result was the
LZW algorithm. The world was informed of the existence of LZW by the
following journal article, published by Mr. Welch after he left the
employment of Sperry:

  Welch, T. A., "A Technique for High Performance Data Compression,"
  IEEE Computer, Volume 17, Number 6, June 1984.

In 1985, Sperry Corporation was granted a patent (4,558,302) for the Welch
invention and implementation of the LZW data compression algorithm. Since
that time, this LZW patent has been publicly available for all to see in
the US Patent Office and many public libraries, and is available through
many on-line services.

In 1987, CompuServe Corporation created the GIF (Graphical Interchange
Format) file format to be used for the storage and on-line retrieval of
bitmapped graphical data. The GIF specification required the use the LZW
algorithm to compress the data stored in each GIF file. It is very
possible that CompuServe did not check the patent files to determine
whether the GIF format infringed on any patents. Such a check would have
found the Welch LZW patent, which was then owned by Unisys as a result of
their having purchased Sperry in 1986. At that time, Unisys also did not
know that LZW was the method of compression used by the very popular GIF
file format.

In 1988, Aldus Corporation released Revision 5 the TIFF file format. This
revision added a new feature giving TIFF the ability to store RGB
bitmapped data using either a raw format, or a compressed format using the
LZW algorithm. (Although the LZW algorithm used by TIFF is considered to
be "broken", it is still covered by the Unisys patent). Since 1991, in
accordance with their agreement with Unisys, Aldus has been required to
place a notice regarding the Unisys patent and its applicability to TIFF,
in Aldus documentation. The 1992 release of Revision 6 of the TIFF
specification includes this notice of the Unisys patent regarding LZW. The
TIFF Revision 6 specification also recommends against using LZW to
compress RGB bitmaps stored using the TIFF format.

In 1990, Unisys licensed Adobe for the use of the Unisys LZW patent for
PostScript.

In 1991, Unisys licensed Aldus for the use of the Unisys LZW patent in
TIFF.

In 1994, Unisys and CompuServe came to an understanding whereby the use of
the LZW algorithm would be licensed for the application of the GIF file
format in software. 

In 1995, America Online Services and Prodigy Services Company also entered
license agreements with Unisys for the utilization of LZW.  Published
information indicates that Unisys' licensing policies are as follows:

 1) Unisys considers all software created or modified before January 1,
    1995 that supports the GIF and/or TIFF-LZW formats to be
    inadvertently infringing upon its patent; Unisys will therefore not
    require a license for GIF software products delivered before January
    1, 1995. Unisys will therefore not pursue legal actions against such
    pre-1995 software products.

 2) However, Unisys expects developers of commercial or for-profit
    software to obtain a GIF-LZW license agreement from Unisys if, after
    December 31, 1994, the developer creates new software or updates or
    modifies existing software, or issues a new release of software that
    supports the GIF file format.

 3) Unisys does not require licensing of non-commercial, not-for-profit
    software applications that support the GIF file format.

 4) With respect to TIFF, if a license is entered before July 1, 1995, 
    there will be no liability for pre-1995 software with respect to
    that software's support of TIFF which uses LZW.

Unisys has drafted licenses for several different applications of the LZW
algorithm. The two license agreements of most interest in this FAQ are
applicable to software supporting the GIF file format alone and the
agreement applicable to software supporting both GIF and the TIFF file
format's LZW compression feature.


Realizing that you have many questions about GIF-LZW and TIFF-LZW
licensing, the remainder of this section is arranged in a Question/Answer
format to help convey information about this subject more clearly.

Q: Just what is this all about?
A: Unisys has asserted its claim to the ownership of the LZW compression 
   and decompression algorithm. If you wish to implement LZW in a software
   or firmware application, you must arrange to pay a small royalty to
   Unisys for every software package that you sell. You do this by applying
   to Unisys for an LZW license agreement for your software.

Q: What file formats are effected?
A: GIF, TIFF, PDF, and PostScript Level II. All of these formats use, or
   can use, LZW compression. For example, a TIFF or PostScript Level II
   file may or may not use the LZW algorithm to compress the data it
   contains. GIF files, and most PDF files, always store bitmap data that
   is compressed using LZW.

Q: How does this agreement affect my use of GIF and TIFF files?
A: It does not affect the ownership, transmission, or reception of GIF
   and TIFF-LZW files themselves. Only the software that performs 
   compression and/or decompression of GIF may be effected in any way
   by license agreements. You are free to store and transport GIF and
   TIFF-LZW files without fear of legalities or cost from the Unisys
   licenses provided that any compression and/or decompression on GIF
   files is performed by licensed software, or by software products
   delivered prior to 1995.

Q: Which agreement do I need?
A: If your software supports only GIF then you need the GIF-LZW agreement.
   If it supports TIFF-LZW or both GIF and TIFF-LZW then you need the 
   TIFF-LZW and GIF-LZW agreement.

Q: My software supports TIFF-LZW, but not GIF.
A: You still need to obtain the TIFF-LZW and GIF-LZW agreement.

Q: So if my software only supports non-LZW versions of TIFF and PostScript
   Level II I don't need to worry about obtaining a license agreement?
A: That is correct. Only software that is capable of using the LZW 
   algorithm requires an agreement. This includes all software that 
   supports the GIF file format.

Q: What about file compression programs such as compress, PKZIP, zoo, and
   lha? Don't they use LZW too?

A: Most file compression programs use the LZ77 algorithm for compressing
   text. The LZ77 compression algorithms (and several of its
   derivatives) predates LZW by several years and is covered by its own
   series of patents.  The predecessor to LZW, LZ78, is used primarily
   for compressing binary data and bitmaps. Any software that uses the
   LZ77 and/or LZ78 algorithms without the LZW improvement is not
   affected by the Unisys LZW patent.  Of the mentioned software
   packages, the Unix compress utility does use LZW and therefore
   requires a license.

Q: Doesn't IBM also hold a patent on LZW?
A: IBM was granted a patent (4,814,746) for use of LZW in disk drive 
   technology. This patent does not award ownership of LZW to IBM.

Q: Is there a chance that the Unisys patent is actually invalid?
A: In 1994, the U.S Patent Office reexamined the Welch patent and, on
   January 4th of that year, not only confirmed the patentability of the
   original 181 patent claims, but also confirmed that 51 claims added
   during the reexamination were also patentable.

Q: But you can't patent a mathematical abstraction. Doesn't this also
   include algorithms implemented as computer software?
A: A patent grants the exclusive rights, title, or license to produce,
   use, or sell an invention or process. One or more algorithms may be
   applied using software to create an invention. It is this invention
   whose use is restricted by the patent and not the algorithm(s) involved.
   In the case of software, it seems that it is not very easy to separate
   the algorithm(s) from the invention itself. Use of the algorithm(s)
   would seem to imply use of the invention as well.

Q: I use LZW in my programs, but not for GIF or TIFF graphics. What should
   I do?
A: If you are not a business, and the programs are for your own personal
   non-commercial or not-for-profit use, Unisys does not require you to 
   obtain a license. If they are used as part of a business and/or you
   sell the programs for commercial or for-profit purposes, then you must
   contact the Welch Patent Licensing Department at Unisys and explain your 
   circumstances. They will have a license agreement for your application
   of their LZW algorithm.

Q: Where can I apply for a GIF-LZW, TIFF-LZW and GIF-LZW, PDF, PostScript 
   Level II, or any other LZW license?
A: You can write to:

     Welch Patent Licensing Department
     Unisys Corporation 
     Mail Stop C1SW19
     P.O. Box 500
     Blue Bell, PA 19424 USA

   Or fax:    215.986.3090

   Or email:  lzw_info@unisys.com

   General licensing information may also be obtained from the home page
   of the Unisys Web Server:

     http://www.unisys.com/

Q: How much does a license cost?
A: The terms and cost of the license policy has changed since its
   introduction in 1995. Contact Unisys for the latest LZW licensing terms.

Q: Do I need a separate license for each GIF-using software product I sell?
A: If you sell three products that all use the GIF format, for example,
   then you will need only one license. License fees must be paid for
   each product sold.

Q: Do I need to obtain a new license if I release a new version of my
   software?
A: No. However, a license fee is required for each update, improvement,
   or enhancement of your software that is sold.

Q: What if I give my software away?
A: If you distribute for free your product directly to end-users for their
   personal use and your distributing the software is non-commercial and
   not-for-profit use and you receive no financial gain (such as Shareware
   donations, royalties for CD-ROM distributions, or as advertising to 
   attract for-profit business), then you do not need a license.

Q: But what about Shareware donations?
A: Each Shareware "payment" you receive is considered the selling price of
   that unit. Whatever a user pays to you for your GIF-using software is
   required to be included in your quarterly license fee payment to Unisys.
   However, minimum license fees per unit must be always paid.

Q: My Shareware GIF software is being sold for-profit on a CD-ROM, but I do
   not make any profit from its sale. Can I get in trouble? Do I need a 
   license?
A: The person/business that is selling your program for profit on their
   CD-ROM is responsible for obtaining the proper license. You would only
   need a license if you received any payments from the CD-ROM vendor or
   from users of your Shareware.

Q: I do not live in the United States and my software is not available
   there. Do I still need to obtain a license agreement?
A: Yes, you do. The Unisys patent has many foreign counterparts and the
   legalities of using LZW apply to most other countries in addition
   the US.

Q: What will happen to me if I continue to revise my GIF-using software,
   sell it for profit, and yet not bother to obtain a license?
A: Most likely, when your unlicensed program is discovered by Unisys,
   you will be notified of your need to obtain a license for your product.
   If you then fail to obtain the proper license, Unisys may seek an 
   injunction against your product including damages. You could also be 
   charged with willful infringement, which could result in treble damages.

Q: On what Usenet newsgroups is this LZW agreement being discussed?
A: You will find threads appearing on comp.graphics.misc and other related
   graphical newsgroups. The official newsgroup where much discussion
   takes place is alt.gif-agreement. You might also find information on
   the misc.legal.computing, misc.int-property, and comp.patents newsgroups.

Q: Where can I get a copy of the Unisys patent?
A: Copies of patents may be found in public libraries or be obtained
   directly from the U.S. Patent Office. The patent is also available
   at many Internet sites, including:

     ftp://cs.columbia.edu/archives/mirror2/world-info/obi/USPatents/lzw-patent.gz
     ftp://ftp.std.com/obi/USPatents/lzw-patent.Z
     ftp://ftp.uu.net/doc/literary/obi/USPatents/lzw-patent.Z
     ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/.8/misc/lzw-patent.Z

Q: What are my alternatives to GIF and TIFF-LZW file formats?
A: A good alternative to LZW for compressing ASCII data is the LZ77
   algorithm used by the zip and PKZIP file archivers and the gzip
   (GNU zip) file compression program. The most popular alternative for
   multi-bit image data is the JPEG compression algorithm and the JFIF
   and SPIFF file formats. JFIF and SPIFF-JPEG files are smaller and
   store far more colors than GIF files.

   Another newer alternative is the PNG format, which is currently under
   development (see the section "PNG - Portable Network Graphics" in
   Part 3 of this FAQ). PNG is unencumbered by patent licenses and has
   much potential and promise in replacing GIF. But, most software that
   supports PNG will likely have been written after January 1, 1995, so
   make sure that your GIF-to-PNG conversion program has the proper
   Unisys license.

Q: Will Unisys' actions hurt the use of GIF?
A: Yes it will. People will continue to write software that supports GIF
   only if their customers demand it. The licensing will hasten the
   eventual demise of GIF, as both people and companies will be more
   motivated to standardize on "free" formats, such as JFIF, SPIFF, PNG, 
   BMP, and TGA.

Q: This agreement is bogus! I refuse to ever use GIF again!
A: As an end-user you are free never to read, write, or archive another
   LZW-encoded file as long as you live. As a developer you are only
   free of the legal implications of the Unisys patent if you remove any
   LZW code from your programs, including those shipped to your customers
   after 1994.

Q: Wait! I have more questions!
A: Contact the Welch Patent Licensing Department at the aforementioned
   addresses. I (the author of this FAQ) am not an employee nor legal
   representative of Unisys. You can also find this information on the
   Unisys web page:

Subject: V. Graphics Formats Misnomers, Misgivings, and Miscellany 

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Why aren't JPEG, MPEG, LZW, and CCITT Group 3 & 4 file formats?

One of the most commonly confused concepts found in file formats is the
difference between the file format and the method(s) of data encoding that
has been used to reduce the size of the data the file contains. JPEG,
MPEG, LZW, and CCITT are all algorithms, or algorithm toolkits, which
encode a stream of data to a physically smaller size. None of these data
compression methods define a specific format used to store data. 

Several formats have become popular based on their use of one or more of
these methods of compression, such as GIF (LZW), JFIF (JPEG), and TIFF
(CCITT Group 3 and Group 4). So if you ask for a "CCITT Group 3" image
file you will most likely get a file containing only CCITT Group 3 data
and not a TIFF file containing bitmapped data compressed using the CCITT
Group 3 algorithm, which might have been what you were expecting.

------------------------------

Subject: 1. Why aren't IGES, GKS, NAPLPS, PCL, and HPGL file formats either?

IGES (Initial Graphics Exchange Specification), GKS (Graphics Kernel
System), NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax),
Xerox Sixel, DEC ReGIS, and Tecktronix vector graphics are not
actually file formats. They are instead protocols which specify how
text and graphical data should be transmitted over a communications
link (such as a serial cable or telephone line) to a remote device
(such as a graphical workstation). 

The X protocol is used by X Window System clients and servers to
communicatte over Ethernet. Although you can save X protocol-encoded
data to a file, this does not mean that there is an "X protocol file
format".

HPGL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language) and PCL (Printer Control
Language) are data stream definition standards used to transfer and 
manipulate data used by printers and plotters.

In most cases, each of these protocols define a previously existing
file format, such as CGM or JFIF, to be the actual format used to
store the graphics data (CGM and PCL use a raw or compressed bitmap).
Occasionally the transmitted data stream may be stored to a file for
buffering or archival purposes. This file is then often identified as
using the "{IGES,GKS,NAPLPS,PCL,HPGL} file format".

Descriptions of each of these standards may be found in Part 3 (Where
to Get File Format Specifications) of this FAQ. For more information
on graphical protocols, have a look at the following:

------------------------------

Subject: 2. Is it "Tag" or "Tagged" Image File Format?

Revision 5.0 of TIFF specification specifically states the acronym "TIFF"
is "Tag Image File Format". The majority of people, however, intuitively
say "Tagged" rather than "Tag". Interestingly enough, the TIFF 6.0
specification does not spell out the acronym TIFF.

------------------------------

Subject: 3. Whaddya mean there's no "Targa" file format?

The popular "Targa" file format is really the "TGA format". "Targa" is the
name of the Truevision graphics display adapter which first used the TGA
format. Specifically, Revision 1.0 of TGA is designated the "Original TGA
format" and Revision 2.0 is the "New TGA Format".

------------------------------

Subject: 4. Choosy programmers choose "gif" or "jif"?

The pronunciation of "GIF" is specified in the GIF specification to be
"jif", as in "jiffy", rather then "gif", which most people seem to prefer.
This does seem strange because the "G" is from the word "Graphics" and not
"Jraphics".

------------------------------

Subject: 5. Why are there so many ".PIC" and ".IMG" formats?

Because people with very little imagination are allowed to choose file
extensions for graphics files, that's why.

But seriously, there does seem to be a proliferation of file formats with
the file extension ".PIC" (for "picture") and ".IMG" (for "image"). Other
popular extensions (in both upper and lower case) are ".RGB", ".RAW",
".ASC", and ".MAP".

My advise to you is never assume the format of a data file based only on
its file extension. The name and the extension of any file are completely
arbitrary and therefore could be anything. This is why the most graphics
file conversion and display programs attempt to recognize graphics files
based on their internal structure and not their file name or extension.

Subject: 0. Maintainer's Comments

This FAQ is for all of you looking for that special display or image
conversion program to run on your system and to work with all those
graphics files you've been downloading from the alt.binaries.pictures.*
newgroups for whose-knows-what reasons.

If you know of any MS-DOS/Windows/Unix/X/Macintosh/Amiga graphical
display, editing, or translation programs or application that are not
listed here then send me the information! I'm also willing to start
sections on VMS, NeXTStep, Atari ST, or just about any other operating
system that the masses demand.

  Comments: I am impressed with the large number of file formats
            supported, including all of their eccentric variations, and
            several formats I have not seen supported in other packages.
            The DOS file directory navigation and maintenance features are
            easy to use and the command line usage is very convenient,
            especially for batch format conversions of images.

  Name:     PICTOPS
  Purpose:  PICture TO PostScript file compressor
  Version:  4.02 (Shareware)
  Author:   Mr. Igor L. Vassiliev <vasiliev_i@mx.ihep.su>
  FTP:      ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/magps402.zip
            ftp://ftp.uniovi.es/pub1/msdos/graphics/magps402.zip
            ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/graphics/magps402.zip
  WWW:      http://www.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/magps402.zip
  Imports:  BMP, GIF, ICO, PCX, PBM, PGM, PPM, RLE, TGA, TIF
  Exports:  Compressed PostScript within Level 2 & 1
  Features: PICTOPS V4.02 is powerful conversion program that converts
            1-,2-,4-,8-,24-, and 32-bit image files to color, gray scale,
            and bi-level PostScript file format. Analogous programs are
            unknown. PICTOPS will compress (PostScript interpreter
            will decompress) image data by CCITTFaxEncode, LZWEncode,
            RunLengthEncode and then by ASCII85Encode or ASCIIHexEncode
            filters. Creation of both ASCII(85) and binary PostScript file.
            PostScript color features support simple 5-operand form
            of the image, 7-operand form colorimage, and image dictionaries.
            CMYK images will be translated to RGB images. PostScript image 
            source data may be provided by string, procedure, or filter.
  Comments: Output from PICTOPS may have much smaller size than standard
            PostScript outs from other programs with simply Level-1.
            In most cases, PKZIP or ARJ cannot compress PostScript out from
            PICTOPS more than 5-20%. If the PostScript device has no
            implementation of level 2, then the program will be run
            as level 1.

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Maintainer's Comments

One of the reasons you are looking through this FAQ collection is most
likely to locate the specification for one or more graphics file formats.
That assumption on my part makes this file one of the most important parts
of the Graphics File Formats FAQ collection. I therefore wish to make this
section as complete as possible.

If you have any suggestions for formats to include then please email me at
jdm@ora.com and let me know!

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What's new in this latest FAQ release?

  o Updated PNG and several Adobe URLs
  o Added AI, MNG, RFT, RTF, DRW, IMA, PIC, PIC, and PIC

  Many of the new sections added have not been completely filled in yet.
  Hopefully I'll have it finished in a near future release.

  Compression: None
  Color Depth: N/A
   Maintainer: Adobe Systems
Specification: ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/DeveloperSupport/TechNotes/PSfiles/5004.AFM_Spec.ps

AFM is Adobe's ASCII-based file format used for storing font metric data as
human-readable data. AFM is the standard Adobe font file format.

This format is also known as the Adobe Multiple Font Metrics (AMFM) and
Adobe Composite Font Metrics (ACFM) file formats. In fact, AFM, AMFM, and
ACFM are actually three variations of the same format. AFM files contain
base or composite font information. One AFM file is used per master design
of a font.  AMFM files store control and global font information for a
group of AFM files. And ACFM files contain the global metrics of the
composite font program.

The specification for the AFM format is:

Subject: Atari ST Graphics File Formats

         Type: Bitmap and animation
    Extension: .ANI, .ANM, .CE?, .FLM, .NEO, .PAC, .PC?,
               .PI?, .RGB, .SEQ, .TNY, .TN?, .UC?
      Version: Variuos
  Compression: None, RLE
  Color Depth:
   Maintainer: 
Specification:

The primary graphics file format of the Atari ST system is the
Electronic Arts Interchange File Format (IFF).  However, a collection
of poorly documented image file formats native to the Atari ST
computer do exist as well. These formats are used primarily for
storing still-images, animations, and screen dumps. 

The Computer Eyes Raw Data Format (.CE1, .CE2), Imagic File/Picture
Format (.IC1, .IC2, .IC3), NEOchrome Format (.NEO), RGB Intermediate
Format (.RGB), STAD Format (.PAC), Tiny Format (.TNY, .TN1, .TN2,
.TN3) are bitmap file formats. The Animatic File Format (.ANM), Cyber
Paint Sequence Format (.SEQ), DEGAS Format (.PI1, PI2, .PI3, .PC1,
.PC2, .PC3), and NEOchrome Animation Format (.ANI) are animation file
formats.

There seems to be no official documentation for most of these
formats. The document, "Atari ST Picture Formats", by David M.
Baggett <dmb@ai.mit.edu> does seem to be the definitive reference.
You can find it at:

  ftp://atari.archive.umich.edu/.../picfmts.doc

You may also find information on Atari ST formats on the
comp.sys.atari.st Usenet newsgroup, and on the following Web sites:

  Compression: None
  Color Depth: 1-bit
   Maintainer: Adobe Systems
Specification: ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/DeveloperSupport/TechNotes/PSfiles/5005.BDF_Spec.ps

BDF is an ASCII-based file format used to store Adobe screen fonts as
human-readable data. The BDF sister format, ABF, stores the same font data
using a binary format.

This format was previously known as the Character Bitmap Distribution
Format, but was renamed to the Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format to bring
the format's name into agreement with current industry terminology.

The specification for the BDF format is:

  Glyph Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF) Specification (Version 2.2),
    Adobe Developer Support, 22 March 1993, P/N LPS5005.

         Type: Bitmap
    Extension: BMP
      Version: 
  Compression: RLE
  Color Depth: 1- to 24-bit
   Maintainer: Microsoft Corporation
Specification:

BMP is the native bitmap file format of the Microsoft Windows environment.
It efficiently stores mapped or unmapped RGB graphics data with pixels 1-,
4-, 8-, or 24-bits in size. Data may be stored raw or compressed using a
4-bit or 8-bit RLE data compression algorithm. BMP is an excellent choice
for a simple bitmap format which supports a wide range of RGB image data.

There is not single document that is the official &quotBMP Format Specification&quot.
Instead, BMP information is spread over several programming references. You 
can search the Microsoft Developers Network CD-ROMs and the Microsoft Knowledge
Base (available at ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/ and http://www.microsoft.com/), but your
best source of BMP information lies outside of Microsoft and within the following
references:

CAD-3D 2.0 stores 3D objects using the 3D, 3D2, or 3D4 file formats. Each format
can store up to 40 objects and contains all information about the objects, 
including the lighting and color palette.

CAD-3D files are similar to the older file format, but they no longer require
the Motorola Fast Floating Point library (LIBF) for the storage of vertex
coordinates. Thia new version stores each coordinate in a two-byte word instead
of a four-byte floating-point value, saving a considerable amount of storage,
and making the file more easily usable by programs written with different
floating-point formats.

         Type: Vector and 3D
    Extension: DXF
      Version: 
  Compression: None
  Color Depth:
   Maintainer: Autodesk
Specification:

The AutoCAD DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) and AutoCAD DXB (Drawing eXhange
Binary) formats are the native vector file formats of Autodesk's AutoCAD
CAD application.

DXF is probably one of the most widely supported vector formats in the
world today. DXF is rich in features, including: support for 3D objects,
curves, text, associative dimensioning, and is an easy format to parse.
The DXB format is a binary representation of a DXF file and they are
usually smaller and faster to load than the equivalent DXF file.

The latest "official" DXF revision is Release 12. However, there is an
even newer version of DXF containing several changes and additions to the
format.  Apparently the specification of the latest version of the DXF
format is not yet (if it will ever be) freely available. Users are
required to pay $4000US for a license to AutoCAD in to obtain the specs
for this newest release of DXF file format.

The official specification for DXF R12 may be found in the AutoCAD Manual
Release 12:

  AutoCAD Customization Manual, Release 12, Autodesk Inc., 1992, pp. 241-81.

The specification for DXF R12 has also been released in electonic form and
is available in several of the Internet file format archives, such as:

  ftp://avalon.vislab.navy.mil/pub/format_specs/dxf_r12.txt.Z
  http://www.mediatel.lu/mmedia/render/h_dxf12.html

The spec for the most current version, DXF R13, is available at:

  ftp://ftp.synapse.net/private/c/cadsyst/misc/r13dxf.zip

And an excerpt of the DXF R10 specification may be found at:

  http://www.mediatel.lu/mmedia/render/h_dxf10.html

Many books detail the DXF format, including:

  The AutoCAD Database Book, F.H. Jones and L. Martin, Ventana Press,
    ISBN 0-940087-04-9. Order: 919.490.0062 voice.

GIF is a data stream-oriented file format used to define the transmission
protocol of LZW-encoded bitmap data. GIF images may be up to eight bits
(256 colors) in depth and are always compressed. Despite the fact that GIF
supports only 8-bits worth of colors, and the multimedia extensions
introduced in the 89a release have not been widely utilized, GIF still
remains a popular choice for storing lower resolution image data.

    Extension: Not specified by specification
      Version: 
  Compression: JBIG
  Color Depth: 1-bit (see text)
   Maintainer: ISO, IEC and ITU
Specification:

JBIG is a lossless method for compressing black and white (1-bit) raster
image data. Its primary benefit is as a method for transmitting bi-level
image data across a communications channel. JBIG's progressive encoding
scheme allows lower resolution version of the image to be sent first,
followed by higher resolution images which build on the previously
transmitted data (e.g. 75, 150, 300, 450, and 600 DPI). This capability makes
JBIG ideal for replacing less-efficient document imaging transmissions
methods, such as CCITT Group 3 & 4, but thus far JBIG has not been marketed
in such a way as to make this possible.

There is no official JBIG file format. You just dump a JBIG data stream into
a disk for tape file, give it the extension JBG or JBIG, and you have a JBIG
file.

JBIG is jointly sponsored by the ITU (CCITT) and ISO/IEC JTCI/SC29
committees. The JBIG standard may be found in the following documents:

  Information technology -- Coded representation of picture and audio
    information -- Progressive bi-level image compression, ISO/IEC 11544:1993

    Extension: mgf
      Version: 1.1
  Compression: None
  Color Depth: full spectral colors (i.e., infinite)
   Maintainer: Greg Ward <GJWard@lbl.gov>
Specification: http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html

MGF is an ASCII-based 3D rendering format designed to model surface geometry
and materials for the purpose of visible-light simulation and rendering.  The
overall objective of this format is to provide a very simple yet fairly
complete modeling language that does not place unreasonable demands on the
applications programmer or the object library creator.

The materials are physically-based and rely on standard and well-accepted
definitions of color, reflectance and transmittance for good accuracy and
reproducibility. The geometry is based on boundary representation using
simple geometric primitives such as polygons, spheres and cones. The file
format itself is terse but human-readable ASCII text.  Translators are
available from 3D Studio and Radiance rendering formats, and to Inventor,
VRML and Radiance.  An ANSI-C standard parser is freely distributed, along
with many models and examples at the official web site.

The format specification is available bundled with an MGF file reader
and is distributed in the file mgflib0.7.tar.Z on the following sites:

  http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html
  ftp://hobbes.lbl.gov/www/mgf

NAPLPS is a protocol for transferring ASCII-based graphical information to
remote terminals via a communications channel (telephone systems, computer
networks, and so forth). It is specifically designed to provide usable
information transfer rates, even at data rates as low as 2400bps.

NAPLPS is used by many Videotext services, Prodigy, the commercial on-line
information service, and in standalone information kiosk systems. 

Although there is no NAPLPS file format, NAPLPS data streams are often saved
as files, and the files are then referred to as using the "NAPLPS file
format".

The NAPLPS specification is a standards documents available through ANSI, ISO,
or CSA. (See the CGM section for the addresses of these organizations). The
CSA document (T500-1983) also contains a supplement (1-1991) which is not
included in the ANSI version of this standard.  

Further information may be found in the February, March, April, and May 1983
issues of Byte Magazine. These articles explain much of the NAPLPS coding
system and discuss the potential for NAPLPS.

Michael Dillon has authored a paper on NAPLPS and started a NAPLPS section on

WorldToolKit software product. WorldToolKit is a C language library providing
the functionality needed to do virtual reality, including file parsing,
sensor drivers, object management, behavior, and rendering.

Sense8's NFF format was loosely adapted from the Videoscape (.geo) format,
with the addition of 12-bit color, per-polygon texture application, and
portals. It was later extended to support vertex normals, 24-bit color, and
vertex uv coordinates. The current version of NFF is 2.1.

Sense8 also supports a binary format of NFF called BFF (.bff file extension)
The BFF format layout and order is identical to the ASCII version, with the
exception that only 24-bit, and not 12-bit, colors are not supported.

Specification:

PCX is one of the oldest bitmapped formats popularized by MS-DOS paint
programs that first appeared in the early 1980's. PCX files may store mapped
and unmapped image data from 1- to 24-bits in pixel depth, always contain
RLE-compressed image data, and are recognized by almost all still-image
graphics programs ever written.

But because of the kludged evolution of the PCX format (caused partly by the
efforts of Zsoft to continue to support the ever-changing world of graphics
display adapters) it is generally advised that the MS Windows BMP format be
used in place of PCX whenever possible.

Once upon a time ZSoft was bought by Wordstar, who was then bought by
SoftKey. It is not currently known if anyone distributes the original,
poorly written, specification for PCX. No matter, as most book on graphics

         Type: Raster
    Extension: PNG
      Version: 
  Compression: RLE
  Color Depth: 1 to 48 bits
   Maintainer: Tom Boutell
Specification: http://www.boutell.com/boutell/png/

PNG (pronounced "ping") is a new bitmap format which is currently in
development. Its creation is an attempt to give the graphics community an
alternative to the shortcomings and misgivings found in most popular file
formats. The current legal situation involving the GIF format may also have
something to do with it too :-)

The following paragraph, excerpted from the PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
specification explains the basic rationale behind the format:

  The PNG format is intended to provide a portable, legally unencumbered,
  simple, lossless, streaming-capable, well-compressed, well-specified
  standard for bitmapped image files which gives new features to the end
  user at minimal cost to the developer.
 
The PNG specification is now in its 10th draft. This draft is considered
finalized to the point that software may be safely written without the worry
of the specification changing in non-backwardly compatable ways.

A public draft of the current PNG specification may be found at:

  http://www.boutell.com/boutell/png/
  ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/documents/png10.txt
  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/

Questions about PNG may be asked on the comp.graphics.misc newsgroup, or via
email at:

  png-info@uunet.uu.net

or directed to the principle author of the PNG specification:

  Thomas Boutell <boutell@boutell.com>

PNG developers may join the PNG mailing list. Send email to

  png-info@uunet.uu.net 

and ask for more information. A human will be reading your request to join
the list, so make it good. Other PNG mailing lists include:

  png-announce@dworkin.wustl.edu    Announcements related to PNG
  png-implement@dworkin.wustl.edu   Implementation discussion

These lists contain a general discussion of PNG, announcements related to
PNG, and discussions regarding PNG implementation. To find out more about
the mailing list server, send mail to png-list-request@dworkin.wustl.edu with
the word "help" (and nothing else) in the message body.

All programs on this site are in beta test and should be used carefully. In
the case of questionable implementation, the specification is to be
considered corrent and the code in error.

Specification: http://www.mediatel.lu/mmedia/render/files/pol.pdf

POL is the native 3D file format for software products created by InnovMetric
Software. The POL format was created to fill the need of storing data
representing multi-contour, simple, planular, polygons using a binary file
format.

InnovMetric Software is developing a complete line of software products for
building 3-D polygonal models using a 3-D imaging system. Two of these
software tools are targeted at real-time 3-D graphics applications.
IMCompress and IMFilter are two complementary tools for optimally reducing
the number of polygons in a 3-D model. IMCompress uses a surface-based
algorithm to downsize highly redundant models such as Digital Terrain Models
and polygonal models generated by a CAD or a 3-D imaging system. IMFilter
uses a volume-based algorithm to create ultra-compact models (20 to 500
triangles) for level of details management in applications requiring
real-time 3-D graphics.

The POL file format specification is primarily distributed as Appendix B of
the IMCompress User's Guide published by InnovMetric Software. The
specification is also available in PostScript format as the file pol.ps in a
few of the graphics file format specification archived listed in part 1 of
this FAQ.

POL was created and is maintained by:

The most well-known of the HandShake formats is Scitex CT (continuous tone).
This format may store from 1 to 16 8-bit color separations (color planes).
Typical CT files store four separation of CMYB image data. Adobe Photoshop
is an application that is commonly used to create Scitex CT image files.

The other HandShake formats include LW (linework, 16 color separations, 255
color maximum), BM (bitmap, 1-bit RLE image data), PG (page layout), and TX
(textual typesetter data). Of these formats, PG and BM have not been fully
implemented by Scitex and may not be in general use elsewhere.

SDML is a spatial description language used for storing CAD and GIS data,
such as found in Landscape Planning, Design, and Architectural databases.

SDML currently exists in two versions: the old SDML format and the new
(Version 1.0) format. The old format is derived from the ASCII-based format
used in the Silicon Graphics CLRview and PolyTRIM software environments. The
new format, released in 05Feb95, is a more detailed, capable, and
size-optimized revision of the old SDML and supports all the features of the
Silicon Graphics CLRMosaic software.

    Extension: SHG
      Version: 
  Compression: None, RLE
  Color Depth:
   Maintainer: Microsoft Corporation
Specification: ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/Multimedia/SHED.ZIP

SHG is a file format used by Microsoft in the WinHelp on-line help facility
found in Windows 3.1. This format is used to save a Microsoft Bitmap (BMP) or
Windows Metafile (WMF) graphic and store the coordinates of specific areas of
the bitmap known as "hotspots".  When the bitmap is displayed and the user
selects a hotspot, WinHelp jumps to another part of the help documentation
via a hyper-text link macro stored in the SHG file.

Another file format used with SHG files is the Multiple-Resolution Bitmap
(MRB) format. MRB files contain one or more SHG images, each rendered at a
different resolution. Several SHG files are typically created using the
SHED.EXE utility and then fed into the MRB compiler to create a single MRB
file. When WinHelp reads the MRB file it chooses which bitmap most closely
matches the resolution of the display.

SHG is currently officially undocumented by Microsoft, but a rather
questionable specification may be found at:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/developr/drg/Multimedia/SHED.ZIP

Information on SHG and MRB may be found in the following journal article:

  Color Depth:
   Maintainer: ITU and ISO
Specification: http://www.itu.doc/

The "official" JPEG file format. Part 3 of the JPEG standard now includes a
fully defined file format to storing JPEG data. 

When the JPEG format was standardized, disagreements among ISO committees
prevented a standard JPEG file format from being created. The defacto format
that appeared was JFIF from C-cube Microsystems. The JFIF format, although
now quite wide-spread, is very limited in capability as file formats go.

SPIFF is intended to replace the JFIF file format, adding features (more
colorspaces, a recognized way of including text blocks, and so forth),
and provding a backwards-compatability allowing SPIFF files to be read my
most JPEG/JFIF decoders. JFIF, however, has a five-year head start on SPIFF,
so the likelyhood of it being completely replaced anytime soon is not good.

environment. WMF files are actually a collection of GDI (Graphics Device
Interface) function calls also native to the Windows environment. When a WMF
file is "played back" (typically using the Windows PlayMetaFile() function)
the graphics is rendered. WMF files are device-independant and have no limit
to their size.

Most books on Microsoft Windows programming contain sections on the internals
of WMF files. The closest thing Microsoft has for a specification for the WMF
format is in Volume 4 of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
Programmer's Reference. Chapter 3 details the internals of the Metafile
Format.

The Microsoft Knowledge Base (available at ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/kb/ and on the
Microsoft Developer Network CD) also contains the complete specification of
WMF. I also highly recommend the book:

  Inside Windows File Formats, Tom Swan, Sams Publishing 1993.
  ISBN 0-672-30338-8 $24.95 softcover, 337 pages.

The placeable metafile format was created by Aldus Corp. to allow the 
positioning of a Windows metafile on a printed page. These metafiles have
a 22-byte header then must be stripped before they can be used by the
Windows API. Have a look at the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  http://www.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/METAFILE.EXE
  This archive contains the METAFILE.HLP help file that describes
  the WMF file format.

  http://www.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/PLAYMETA.EXE
  This archive contains sample Windows code to manipulate WMF files.

WPG is the native graphics file format of the WordPerfect Corporation line
of software products. For this reason it is common to find WPG files in
MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, and Unix environments.

WPG files may store bitmapped or vector graphics data, or Encapsulated
PostScript data as well. Bitmapped data may be up to 24-bits deep and
selectable from a palette of 256 colors. 

The WPG specification is published in the WordPerfect Corporation

   Maintainer: 
Specification:

XBM is a native file format of The X Window System and is used for storing
cursor and icon bitmaps that are used in the X GUI. XBM files are quite
different in that they are actually C language source files that are
created to be read by a C compiler rather than a graphical display
program.

XBM data is typically found in headers (.h files) and are a series of
static unsigned char arrays containing the monochrome pixel data. There is
one array per image stored in the header.

XBM was created by the X Consortium as part of the X Window System. Refer
to the /bitmaps directory of the X Window distribution for examples of XBM
files. The central FTP distribution site for X version 11 is:

  ftp://ftp.x.org

XWD is used to store screen dumps created by the xwd client process in the
X Window System. The image of any window or the background may be saved
(dumped) to an XWD file. Using the following command:

  xwd -root > bg.xwd

The background is saved to the file bg.xwd. By replacing the "root" flag
with the ID of a window, only that window will be saved to the XWD file.

XWD was created by the X Consortium as part of the X Window System. Refer
to the /usr/include/X11 directory for header files (XWDFile.h) that define
the X10 and X11 versions of the XWD format.  The central FTP distribution

Subject: I. General questions about this FAQ 

------------------------------

Subject: 0. Maintainer's Comments

Programmer's are code-hungry people. They just want the secrets and they want
them to work NOW! But always in the back of a hack's mind there are the
questions: "Is this really the best way to do this? Could it be better?".

This FAQ is to share ideas on the implementation details of reading, writing,
converting, and displaying graphics file formats. You'll probably get some
good ideas here, find a few things you didn't know about, and even have a few
suggestions and improvements of you own to add (send them to jdm@ora.com).

If you need to know the best way to do something with file formats, or
just find it embarrassing to implement a chunk of some other programmer's
code and then have to admit you really don't understand how it works, then
this FAQ is for you.

Subject: 0. What's the best way to read a file header?

You wouldn't think there's a lot of mystery about reading a few bytes from
a disk file, eh? Programmer's, however, are constantly loosing time
because they don't consider a few problems that may occur and cause them
to loose time. Consider the following code:

  typedef struct _Header
  {
    BYTE Id;
    WORD Height;
    WORD Width;
    BYTE Colors;
  } HEADER;

  HEADER Header;

  void ReadHeader(FILE *fp)
  {
    if (fp != (FILE *)NULL)
      fread(&Header, sizeof(HEADER), 1, fp);
  }

Looks good, right? The fread() will read the next sizeof(HEADER) bytes from
a valid FILE pointer into the Header data structure. So what could go
wrong?

The problem often encountered with this method is one of element alignment
within structures. Compilers may pad structures with "invisible" elements
to allow each "visible" element to align on a 2- or 4-byte address
boundary.  This is done for efficiency in accessing the element while in
memory. Padding may also be added to the end of the structure to bring
it's total length to an even number of bytes. This is done so the data
following the structure in memory will also align on a proper address
boundary.

If the above code is compiled with no (or 1-byte) structure alignment the
code will operate as expected. With 2-byte alignment an extra two bytes
would be added to the HEADER structure in memory and make it appear as
such:

  typedef struct _Header
  {
    BYTE Id;
    BYTE Pad1;      // Added padding
    WORD Height;
    WORD Width;
    BYTE Colors;
    BYTE Pad2;      // Added padding
  } HEADER;

As you can see the fread() will store the correct value in Id, but the
first byte of Height will be stored in the padding byte. This will throw
off the correct storage of data in the remaining part of the structure
causing the values to be garbage.

A compiler using 4-byte alignment would change the HEADER in memory as such:

  typedef struct _Header
  {
    BYTE Id;
    BYTE Pad1;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad2;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad3;      // Added padding
    WORD Height;
    WORD Width;
    BYTE Colors;
    BYTE Pad4;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad5;      // Added padding
    BYTE Pad6;      // Added padding
  } HEADER;

What started off as a 6-byte header increased to 8 and 12 bytes thanks to
alignment. But what can you do? All the documentation and makefiles you
write will not prevent someone from compiling with the wrong options flag
and then pulling their (or your) hair out when your software appears not
to work correctly.

Now considering this alternative to the ReadHeader() function:

  HEADER Header;

  void ReadHeader(FILE *fp)
  {
    if (fp != (FILE *)NULL)
    {
      fread(&Header.Id, sizeof(Header.Id), 1, fp);
      fread(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);
      fread(&Header.Width, sizeof(Header.Width), 1, fp);
      fread(&Header.Colors, sizeof(Header.Colors), 1, fp);
    }
  }

What both you and your compiler now see is a lot more code. Rather than
reading the entire structure in one, elegant shot, you read in each
element separately using multiple calls to fread(). The trade-off here is
increased code size for not caring what the structure alignment option of
the compiler is set to. These cases are also true for writing structures
to files using fwrite(). Write only the data and not the padding please.

But is there still anything we've yet over looked? Will fread() (fscanf(),
fgetc(), and so forth) always return the data we expect?  Will fwrite()
(fprintf(), fputc(), and so forth) ever write data that we don't want, or
in a way we don't expect? Read on to the next section...

------------------------------

Subject: 1. What's this business about endianness?

So you've been pulling you hair out trying to discover why your elegant
and perfect-beyond-reproach code, running on your Macintosh or Sun, is
reading garbage from PCX and TGA files. Or perhaps your MS-DOS or Windows
application just can't seem to make heads or tails out of that Sun Raster
file. And, to make matters even more mysterious, it seems your most
illustrious creation will read some TIFF files, but not others.

As was hinted at in the previous section, just reading the header of a
graphics file one field is not enough to insure data is always read correctly
(not enough for portable code, anyway). In addition to structure, we must also
consider the endianness of the file's data, and the endianness of the
system's architecture our code is running on.

Here's are some baseline rules to follow:

  1) Graphics files typically use a fixed byte-ordering scheme. For example, 
     PCX and TGA files are always little-endian; Sun Raster and Macintosh
     PICT are always big-endian.
  2) Graphics files that may contain data using either byte-ordering scheme
     (for example TIFF) will have an identifier that indicates the
     endianness of the data.
  3) ASCII-based graphics files (such as DXF and most 3D object files),
     have no endianness and are always read in the same way on any system.
  4) Most CPUs use a fixed byte-ordering scheme. For example, the 80486
     is little-endian and the 68040 is big-endian.
  5) You can test for the type of endianness a system using software.
  6) There are many systems that are neither big- nor little-endian; these
     middle-endian systems will possibly cause such byte-order detection
     tests to return erroneous results.

Now we know that using fread() on a big-endian system to read data from a
file that was originally written in little-endian order will return
incorrect data. Actually, the data is correct, but the bytes that make up
the data are arranged in the wrong order. If we attempt to read the 16-bit
value 1234h from a little-endian file, it would be stored in memory using
the big-endian byte-ordering scheme and the value 3412h would result. What
we need is a swap function to change the resulting position of the bytes:

  WORD SwapTwoBytes(WORD w)
  {
      register WORD tmp;
      tmp =  (w & 0x00FF);
      tmp = ((w & 0xFF00) >> 0x08) | (tmp << 0x08);
      return(tmp);
  }
  
Now we can read a two-byte header value and swap the bytes as such:

  fread(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);
  Header.Height = SwapTwoBytes(Header.Height);

But what about four-byte values? The value 12345678h would be stored as
78563412h. What we need is a swap function to handle four-byte values:

  DWORD SwapFourBytes(DWORD dw)
  {
      register DWORD tmp;
      tmp =  (dw & 0x000000FF);
      tmp = ((dw & 0x0000FF00) >> 0x08) | (tmp << 0x08);
      tmp = ((dw & 0x00FF0000) >> 0x10) | (tmp << 0x08);
      tmp = ((dw & 0xFF000000) >> 0x18) | (tmp << 0x08);
      return(tmp);
  }

But how do we know when to swap and when not to swap? We always know the
byte-order of a graphics file that we are reading, but how do we check
what the endianness of system we are running on is? Using the C language,
we might use preprocessor switches to cause a conditional compile based on
a system definition flag:

  #define MSDOS     1
  #define WINDOWS   2
  #define MACINTOSH 3
  #define AMIGA     4
  #define SUNUNIX   5
  
  #define SYSTEM    MSDOS
  
  #if defined(SYSTEM == MSDOS)  
    // Little-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == WINDOWS)  
    // Little-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == MACINTOSH)  
    // Big-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == AMIGA)  
    // Big-endian code here
  #elif defined(SYSTEM == SUNUNIX)  
    // Big-endian code here
  #else
  #error Unknown SYSTEM definition
  #endif

My reaction to the above code was *YUCK!* (and I hope yours was too!).  A
snarl of fread(), fwrite(), SwapTwoBytes(), and SwapFourBytes() functions
laced between preprocessor statements is hardly elegant code, although
sometimes it is our best choice. Fortunately, this is not one of those
times.

What we first need is a set of functions to read the data from a file
using the byte-ordering scheme of the data. This effectively combines the
read\write and swap operations into one set of functions. Considering the
following:

  WORD GetBigWord(FILE *fp)
  {
      register WORD w;
      w =  (WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF);
      w = ((WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF)) | (w << 0x08);
      return(w);
  }
  
  WORD GetLittleWord(FILE *fp)
  {
      register WORD w;
      w =  (WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF);
      w |= ((WORD) (fgetc(fp) & 0xFF) << 0x08);
      return(w);
  }
  
  DWORD GetBigDoubleWord(FILE *fp)

  }

If we were reading a little-endian file on a big-endian system (or visa
versa), the previous code:

  fread(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);
  Header.Height = SwapTwoBytes(Header.Height);

Would be replaced by:
  
  Header.Height = GetLittleWord(fp);

The code to write the same value to a file would be changed from:

  Header.Height = SwapTwoBytes(Header.Height);
  fwrite(&Header.Height, sizeof(Header.Height), 1, fp);

To the slightly more readable:

  PutLittleWord(Header.Height, fp);

Note that these functions are the same regardless of the endianness of a
system. For example, the ReadLittleWord() will always read a two-byte value
from a little-endian file regardless of the endianness of the system;
PutBigDoubleWord() will always write a four-byte big-endian value, and so
forth.

Subject: 2. How can I determine the byte-order of a system at run-time?

You may wish to optimize how you read (or write) data from a graphics file
based on the endianness of your system. Using the GetBigDoubleWord()
function mentioned in the previous section to read big-endian data from a
file on a big-endian system imposes extra overhead we don't really need
(although if the actual number of read/write operations in your program is
small you might not consider this overhead to be too bad).

If our code could tell what the endianness of the system was at run-time,
it could choose (using function pointers) what set of read/write functions
to use. Look at the following function:

  #define BIG_ENDIAN      0
  #define LITTLE_ENDIAN   1

  int TestByteOrder(void)
  {
      short int word = 0x0001;
      char *byte = (char *) &word;
      return(byte[0] ? LITTLE_ENDIAN : BIG_ENDIAN);
  }

This code assigns the value 0001h to a 16-bit integer. A char pointer is
then assigned to point at the first (least-significant) byte of the
integer value.  If the first byte of the integer is 01h, then the system
is little-endian (the 01h is in the lowest, or least-significant,
address). If it is 00h then the system is big-endian.

Subject: 3. How can I identify the format of a graphics file?

When writing any type of file or data stream reader it is very important
to implement some sort of method for verifying that the input data is in
the format you expect. Here are a few methods:

1) Trust the user of your program to always supply the correct data,
thereby freeing you from the tedious task of writing any type of format
identification routines. Choose this method and you will provide solid
proof that contradicts the popular claim that users are inherently far
more stupid than programmers.

2) Read the file extension or descriptor. A GIF file will always have the
extension .GIF, right? Targa files .TGA, yes?  And TIFF files will have an
extension of .TIF or a descriptor of TIFF. So no problem?

Well, for the most part, this is true. This method certainly isn't
bulletproof, however.  Your reader will occasionally be fed the odd-batch
of mis-label files ("I thought they were PCX files!"). Or files with
unrecognized mangled extensions  (.TAR rather than .TGA or .JFI rather
than .JPG) that your reader knows how to read, but won't read because it
doesn't recognize the extensions. File extensions also won't usually tell
you the revision of the file format you are reading (with some revisions
creating an almost entirely new format). And more than one file format
share the more common file extensions (such as .IMG and .PIC). And last of
all, data streams have no file extensions or descriptors to read at all.

3) Read the file and attempt to recognize the format by specific patterns
in the data. Most file formats contain some sort of identifying pattern of
data that is identical in all files. In some cases this pattern gives and
indication of the revision of the format (such as GIF87a and GIF89a) or
the endianness of the data format.

Nothing is easy, however. Not all formats contain such identifiers (such
as PCX). And those that do don't necessarily put it at the beginning of
the file. This means if the data is in the format of a stream you many
have to read (and buffer) most or all of the data before you can determine
the format. Of course, not all graphics formats are suitable to be read as
a data stream anyway.

Your best bet for a method of format detection is a combination of methods
two and three. First believe the file extension or descriptor, read some
data, and check for identifying data patterns. If this test fails, then
attempt to recognize all other known patterns.

Run-time file format identification a black-art at best.

Subject: 4. What are the format identifiers of some popular file formats?

Here are a few algorithms that you can use to determine the format of a
graphics file at run-time.


GIF: The first six bytes of a GIF file will be the byte pattern of 
     474946383761h ("GIF87a") or 474946383961h ("GIF89a").

JFIF: The first three bytes are ffd8ffh (i.e., an SOI marker followed
      by any marker). Do not check the fourth byte, as it will vary.

JPEG: The first three bytes are ffd8ffh (i.e., an SOI marker followed
      by any marker). Do not check the fourth byte, as it will vary.
      This works with most variants of "raw JPEG" as well.

PNG: The first eight bytes of all PNG files are 89504e470d0a1a0ah.

SPIFF: The first three bytes are ffd8ffh (i.e., an SOI marker followed
       by any marker). Do not check the fourth byte, as it will vary.

Sun: The first four bytes of a Sun Rasterfile are 59a66a95h. If you have
     accidentally read this identifier using the little-endian byte order
     this value will will be read as 956aa659h.

TGA: The last 18 bytes of a TGA Version 2 file is the string
     "TRUEVISION-XFILE.\0". If this string is not present, then the file
     is assumed to be a TGA Version 1 file.

TIFF: The first four bytes of a big-endian TIFF files are 4d4d002ah and
      49492a00h for little-endian TIFF files.
