use pigs2/gfxfmt.lib instead of bmp.cc, tga.cc, sgi.cc, et al
remove profile.cc; use pigs2/ini.lib instead
move IFF chunk definitions to subdirectories of pigs2/iff

Make stream output for Bitmap classes
Make stream output for AllocMap
* Remove palette class entirely -- it's actually no different than Bitmap
NEW IDEA: maybe make a palette class, but derive it from Bitmap class

*1. RMUV interface (asset id, material # -> x,y,w,h)
*2. read iff file instead of pf3, vrml
*3. 24-bit Targa files / 24-bit Windows .bmp files
4. partition VRAM

*3.5 levelcon update
*3.9 scarecrows

* rmuv is now in gfx.  textile should use that definition instead of its own local one
