World Foundry documentation project
===================================

Currently the WF-GDK documentation is being converted to the universal
DocBook format.  Please refer to the online documentation to be found
at the main website[1] in the meantime.

If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the documentation of
this project, please post them in the Open Discussion forum[2] on the
SourceForge website.  I will be checking this forum regularly and would
appreciate any feedback.  You can also email me directly[3] via the
SourceForge website - kindly put "World Foundry Documentation" in the
Subject header so your email doesn't get mislaid (or worse).
