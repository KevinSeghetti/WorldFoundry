This package contains several plugins for use with Innovation3D.

To install the packages do:
bash$ make -f Makefile.dist
bash$ ./configure
bash$ make
bash$ make install


/usr/local/i3d

If you installed it somewhere else, you can use the configure optiosn to specify where it is installed.  The same goes for NURBS++ and QT


By default, all plugins are installed to I3DDIR/Plugins.  If you wish to change this location, you can set it with the prefix option of configure.
