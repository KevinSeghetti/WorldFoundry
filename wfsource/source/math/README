Just a note here about a point that confused me untill I seen what was being 
done:

*Most* of these directories that have sub-dirs by port name (./linux, ./win)
rely on the "VPATH=$(WF_TARGET)" in the .env file so that make can find the 
source files.

BUT NOT THE CASE HERE!!!!!!!!!!

Here you will find files in this directory with the same name as files in the 
port directories.  The files in this directory #include the ones in the port
directories!

THUS make NEVER MESSES WITH ./$(WF_TARGET)/* !
