release notes for the alpha version of the HAL/PIGS tasker:


timer device is not quite done.

example game loop/usage will be done by monday morning.

Please QMail any questions/suggestions/complaints/etc to Kevin Seghetti

if you invoke the gnu make with 'make testhal', it will build a test
application which will exercise portions of the library. These tests are
not designed to be examples of use, they have way too much internal detail.

the next version will be posted in the version control system as soon as I
set it up on the novell server.

files which start with _(underbar) are private to the HAL

all files are subject to change.
