    // kts figure out why Scalar has a ostream operator<< when DO_IOSTREAMS is 0

//==============================================================================

write a few flipcode tip of the days:
use preprocessor to allow one data file to generate multiple different outputs (like the renderer enum)

redirectable strings

AssertMsg

General:

Linux specific:

Engine:

Implement div0 / int overflow hander: WF expects integer overflows to just
return the largest possible integer. Same for divide by 0. 

implement joystick interface (currently only keyboard)

Investigate Crystal Space as a renderer (does it have immediate mode
style behaviour?). Look at other toolkits (I would rather leverage some
other GPL'ed renderer than continue to write our own).


Pathway:

Implement all functionality we have in 3dsmax:
	attributes multipaste
	select objects by attributes
	project build toolbar
	geometry exporter (to iff)
	
make some cool levels to show off what we can do!
